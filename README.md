# Quadratic London

Quadratic London is dedicated to implementing and promoting alternative forms of governance and quadratic voting mechanisms. By raising social awareness of the benefits of [quadratic voting](what-is-quadratic-voting/), we aim to enhance decision-making processes and foster more democratic outcomes.&#x20;

If you wish to skip straight into the voting simulation head to the [Participate HERE](participate-here.md) section. We are working on creating a protocol with everything in one place, apologies for the multi step process, we know its a little confusing to navigate!

Since the recent London Mayoral election and the upcoming UK General Election, we have decided to run a mock voting simulation that asks potential voters to determine the outcome of funding for six projects related to the prevention and resolution of crime and violence in London. These projects are _hypothetical_ but loosely based on existing reform programs pending funding. Each person will be asked to complete two polls, both of which can be found [here](https://forms.gle/joYmn3xNE1RuHBTj8).

One poll will use the traditional plurality voting method, and the other will utilize quadratic voting.&#x20;

The initial aim for Quadratic London is to collect a small data set to compare the results from the two polls. Each participant will receive the results of the mock poll by the end of July, along with a data dashboard. Participants are encouraged to provide critiques along the way and suggest novel ways of presenting the results.
