# Quadratic London

Quadratic London is an ongoing project implementing and promoting alternative forms of governance and quadratic voting mechanisms. By raising social awareness of the benefits of [quadratic voting](what-is-quadratic-voting/), we aim to enhance decision-making processes and foster more democratic outcomes.

In the summer of 2024 we ran a trial where members of the public were asked to vote in two polls, one using [traditional voting](what-is-quadratic-voting/one-person-one-vote.md) the other [quadratic voting](what-is-quadratic-voting/). The results can be found [here](results.md).



The project details were as follows...

_Following the recent London Mayoral election and in anticipation of the upcoming UK General Election, we are launching a mock voting simulation. This initiative invites participants to vote on funding allocations for six hypothetical projects aimed at preventing and addressing crime and violence in London. While these projects are fictional, they are inspired by real reform programs currently awaiting funding._

_Each participant will complete two polls, accessible via the provided link. The primary goal of Quadratic London is to gather a small dataset to compare the outcomes of these polls. By the end of July, participants will receive the mock poll results along with an interactive data dashboard._

_We encourage participants to share feedback throughout the process, offering critiques and suggesting innovative ways to present the findings._
