# Quadratic London

Quadratic London is dedicated to implementing and promoting alternative governance and quadratic voting mechanisms. By raising social awareness of the benefits of [quadratic voting](what-is-quadratic-voting/), we aim to enhance decision-making processes and foster more democratic outcomes.&#x20;

To navigate around the site on mobile devices you can click the icon (top left) to view various sections or scroll to the bottom to head to the next page. Estimated read time is 5-10 mins. If you wish to skip straight into the voting simulation head to the [Participate HERE](participate-here.md) section.

Since the recent London Mayoral election and the upcoming UK General Election, we have decided to run a mock voting simulation that asks potential voters to determine the outcome of funding for six projects related to the prevention and resolution of crime and violence in London. These projects are _hypothetical_ but loosely based on existing reform programs pending funding. Each person will be asked to complete two polls, both of which can be found [here](https://forms.gle/joYmn3xNE1RuHBTj8).

One poll will use the traditional plurality voting method, and the other will utilize quadratic voting. Quadratic London will canvass Islington and Hackney for participants, as well as engage in online campaigning on community websites like Nextdoor.

The initial aim for Quadratic London is to collect a small data set to compare the results from the two polls. Each participant will receive the results of the mock poll by the end of July, along with a data dashboard. Participants are encouraged to provide critiques along the way and suggest novel ways of presenting the results.
