# What's next for Quadratic London

Quadratic London is reaching out to grassroots initiatives across the UK as well as charities and media organizations. We aim for 500-1000 participants over the next two weeks. We have also included a small incentive with a raffle for participants. Details of which can be found on the submission form.

Quadratic London is a passion project with ambitions for growth into the public domain over the next few years.

It would be a privilege to discuss our project further with you. Should you find the project of interest, we would be grateful if you would be willing to share this initial simulation vote with your network.
