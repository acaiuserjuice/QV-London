# Plurality

Boiled down plurality voting simply means that a candidate/project can win with only a plurality (more votes than any other candidate) rather than a majority. Its often (awkwardly) called "first-past-the-post" (FPTP).

In a hypothetical poll with three projects (A, B, and C) and 100 voters:

* Project A receives 40 votes.
* Project B receives 35 votes.
* Project C receives 25 votes.

In a plurality voting system, Project A wins the poll because they have more votes than either Project B or Project C, even though Project A does not have the majority (more than 50%) of the total votes.

Lets compare this to a quadratic vote.

Following our single parent example from before, lets imagine they represent project C and the single parents who wish for subsidised child care decide to use all of their voice credits (100) solely on project C. Project A and B voters were keen to delegate a _partial_ allocation of their credits to help single parents but still prioritise projects A and B.&#x20;

* Project A: 3850 credits
* Project B: 2900 credits
* Project C: 3250 credits

The weighted outcome is quite different in comparison to the plurality vote. In this example, such an outcome could highlight sentiment within communities much faster. Spend a few moments to compare the outcomes between the two votes. In the plurality vote, voters had to chose one option only. In the quadratic vote, votes can be distributed across the array of options.
