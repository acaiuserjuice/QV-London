# How Quadratic voting works

Quadratic voting allows individuals to cast votes on issues based on the strength of their preference. The cost of each additional vote grows quadratically, meaning if 1 vote costs 1 credit, 2 votes cost 4 credits (2²), 3 votes cost 9 credits (3²), and so on. this system ensures that only those with strong preferences will use more credits, balancing majority rule with minority interests. you can vote negative if you wish.

Here is the Quadratic cost of using your votes, this example shows the expenditure of your credits if you were to vote with strength in one direction on on one cause.&#x20;
