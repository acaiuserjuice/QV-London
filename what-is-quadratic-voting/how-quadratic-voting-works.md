# How Quadratic voting works

Quadratic voting allows individuals to cast votes on issues based on the strength of their preference. The cost of each additional vote grows quadratically, meaning if 1 vote costs 1 credit, 2 votes cost 4 credits (2²), 3 votes cost 9 credits (3²), and so on. this system ensures that only those with strong preferences will use more credits, balancing majority rule with minority interests. Imagine you have 100 credits to delegate over an array of issues. Below you can see the cost of your expression. You can vote negative if you wish.

This mechanism discourages any single individual from dominating the voting process unless they have a very strong preference and are willing to incur the higher costs for additional votes. Here is the Quadratic cost of using your votes, this example shows the expenditure of your credits if you were to vote with strength in one direction on on one cause.&#x20;
