# Public goods

Public goods are services or products that are available to all members of a society and whose use by one individual does not reduce their availability to others. Examples include clean air, national defence, public parks, and street lighting.

"Public goods" refer to situations where individuals receive benefits from shared resources and investments that often exceed the value of their individual contributions. These goods cannot be efficiently priced because it is costly or inefficient to exclude individuals from accessing them. Public good's are activities with increasing returns, where the socially efficient price to charge (marginal cost) is significantly lower than the average cost of creating the good (Buterin, Hitzig, & Weyl, 2019)
