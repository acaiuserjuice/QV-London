# What is Quadratic Voting?

Quadratic voting is a mechanism that enables people to participate in governance. Governance is how organizations and society establish rules and dynamic processes that impact our daily lives. Think of mayoral elections, [public goods](public-goods.md) (like biodiversity and public services), and the distribution of funding within the NHS, for example. However, the traditional forms of governance we rely on often have inherent design flaws that hinder decision-making and consensus-building, commonly referred to as 'groupthink'. There is no perfect solution or one-size-fits-all form of governance, and this will be covered in more depth later.
