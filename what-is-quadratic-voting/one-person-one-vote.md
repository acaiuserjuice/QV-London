# One person, one vote

"One person, one vote" is a principle that ensures each person's vote has equal weight in an election. It is a fundamental aspect of democratic electoral systems, guaranteeing that all individuals have an equal opportunity to influence the election outcome. This principle combats unequal representation, ensuring that electoral districts are drawn so that each one has roughly the same population.
