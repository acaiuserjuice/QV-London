# Results

A total of 87 completed polls were submitted for the Quadratic London alternative governance project.  There were 15 incomplete polls, general feedback being difficulty of navigation and too many steps. There were 74 email respondents, 13 ENS (Ethereum) respondents.

A QR code campaign was ran online and flyers we handed out whilst talking to the public around Islington and Hackney, London.

Although the project had its flaws in terms of messaging and ease of data collection which resulted in lower than expected participation the results are nevertheless interesting and serve as benchmark for improvement, most importantly the polls in comparison indicate quadratic voting does express the intensity of the voters preference.
