# Voting Simulation

[_Quadratic voting_](../what-is-quadratic-voting/) is an alternative governance method that allows participants to express the strength of their preferences on a range of agendas set by a council or election board. We will discuss QV and its workings in the next section. For now let's start with role playing a voting scenario so you can follow along.

Here are six hypothetical projects shortlisted for funding by the London Mayoral office.

_(you can read in more detail about these projects on the_ [_following page_](projects-for-consideration.md)_)_

1. **Youth Empowerment and Mentorship Program:** _Prevention_ - Cost: £3 Million
2. **Community Safety and Policing Reform Initiative:** _Resolution_ - Cost: £4 Million
3. **Mental Health Support and Counselling Services Expansion:** _Prevention_ - Cost: £2.5 Million
4. **Education and Outreach Campaign on Conflict Resolution:** _Resolution_ - Cost: £1.5 Million
5. **Rehabilitation and Reintegration Program for Former Offenders:** _Resolution_ - Cost: £4 Million
6. **School and Community Programs to Reduce Substance Abuse:** _Prevention_ - Cost: £5 Million

The Mayoral office has £10 million to allocate to one or more of these programs, but the total cost to fully fund all projects is £20 million. The office is unsure how to distribute the money quickly. Statistics show that knife crime and violence are rising ([_violence dashboard)_](https://data.london.gov.uk/mopac-pcp-dashboard/violence-is-prevented-and-reduced-dashboard/). Committees governed by the London Assembly investigate, gauge resource needs, and report their findings. The assembly and the mayor then attempt to reach a consensus on the best distribution of funds to help reduce crime.

Now, we urge you to read the six hypothetical programs and consider how they might, with adequate funding, achieve a net positive for society. Alternatively, you may conclude that some programs are not important enough for your voting credits (e.g., currently heavily funded, lack of urgency, or public mistrust). You may start to recognize that reaching a consensus involves extensive decision-making among elected officials, committees, and the public. This process often becomes tainted with ideological swings and is heavily politicized before data feedback. While not inherently bad, this process can be wasteful in terms of time and money, which are essentially public resources.
